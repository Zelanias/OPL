From the first test, it tested adding a variable with a function that added 3 to it, which resulted in 23. The next test was running the function first, which resulted in the same answer, as there are no pointers, it kept the original value of 10 for the rest of the statement. Third test was having x++ + method, which resulted in 24, which is the same one as the first test but adds 1 after. The 4th test, is method first and ++x, which resulted in 24 as well, beacuse method ran first and then added 1 to x. The last test is ++x and then the method, which results in 25, because it does the ++x before the method.
